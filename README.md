After Firefox 29.0 the status bar was removed. To get it back, it's required to install an Addon like 'The Addon Bar (Restored)' https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/

To install Bitcoinbar download 'bitcoinbar-1.0-fx.xpi' and drag the file into Firefox Browser.

Note: The Addon is not compatible with Firefox Quantum!
